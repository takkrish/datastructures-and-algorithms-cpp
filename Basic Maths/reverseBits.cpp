// Problem statement
// There is a song concert going to happen in the city. The price of each ticket is equal to the number obtained after reversing the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer ‘n’.

// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Sample Input 1 :
// 2
// 0
// 12
// Sample Output 1:
//  0
//  805306368
// Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
// For the first test case :
// Since the given number N = 0 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000000 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 00000000000000000000000000000000 which is equal to 0 only. So the output is 0.     



// For the second test case :
// Since the given number N = 12 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000001100 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 0110000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 805306368 only. So the output is 805306368.
// Sample Input 2 :
// 2
// 6
// 4
// Sample Output 2 :
//  1610612736
//  536870912
// Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
// For the first test case :
// Since the given number N = 6 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000110 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 01100000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 1610612736.


// For the second test case :
// Since the given number N = 4 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000100 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 0010000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 536870912 only.
// Expected time complexity:
// The expected time complexity is O(log(n)).
// Constraints :
// 1 <= T <= 10
// 0 <= N <= 2^32

// Time Limit: 1 sec
